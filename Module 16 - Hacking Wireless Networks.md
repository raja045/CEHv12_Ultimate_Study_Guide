# Hacking Wireless Networks

- Wireless networks uses radio-wave transmission, which usually occurs at physical layer of the network structure.

### Wi-Fi Authentication Modes
- Open system authentication process
- Shared key authentication process
- Centralized Authentication Server (RADIUS)

### Types of wireless antennas
- Directional Antenna
- Omnidirectional Antenna

## Wireless Encryption

### Types of Wireless Encryption
- **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)** : old wireless security standarad.
- **TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol** : Security protocol used in a WPA as a replacement for WEP.
- **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)** : Advanced wireless encryption protocol using TKIP and message Integrity Check (MIC) to provide strong encryption and authentication.
- **WPA2** : upgarde to WPA using AES.
- **WPA3**: Third generation Wi-Fi security protocol that provides new features.
- **EAP** : Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) supports multiple authentication methods, such as token cards, Kerberos, and certificates.
- **LEAP** : Lightweight EAP developed by cisco.
- **PEAP** (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) : protocol that encapsulates the EAP within an encrypted and authenticated Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnel.
